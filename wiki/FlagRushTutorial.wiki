= Diving into the Multiplayer Flag Rush Tutorial =

If you've never heard of jME's Flag Rush tutorials, you can find information about them here:

   * FlagRush

I recommend taking a look at these three classes to see what JGN can do, especially with regard to JME:

   * FlagRushTest
   * FlagRushTestServer
   * FlagRushTestClient

The above classes exhibit points of contact between JGN and JME, as does this one:

   * [wiki:JMEGraphicalController]

After examining the files listed above, you may wish to understand the following important classes:

   * [wiki:JGN]
   * [wiki:JGNClient]
   * [wiki:JGNServer]
   * SynchronizationManager
   * GameTaskQueueManager
   * MessageListener
   * SyncObjectManager
   * SynchronizeMessage
   * SyncWrapper
   * [wiki:Future]
   * [wiki:Callable]
   * [wiki:Field]

Some of these classes (such as [wiki:Future] and [wiki:Callable]) do not lie within the explicit domain of the JGN software.  Nevertheless, an understanding of each of them will yield a deeper understanding of concurrency, network programming, reflection, and how JGN and JME relate.
